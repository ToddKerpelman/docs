This value will not change unless Plaid can't reconcile the account with the data returned by the financial institution. This may occur, for example, when the name of the account changes.

In that case, the new `account_id` will be different from the old `account_id`.\n\nIf an account with a specific `account_id` disappears instead of changing, the account is likely closed. Closed accounts are not returned by the Plaid API.\n\nWhen using a CRA endpoint (an endpoint associated with Plaid Check Consumer Report, i.e. any endpoint beginning with `/cra/`), the `account_id` returned will not match the `account_id` returned by a non-CRA endpoint.\n\nLike all Plaid identifiers, the `account_id` is case sensitive."

In that case, the new `account_id` will be different from the old `account_id`.\n\nIf an account with a specific `account_id` disappears instead of changing, the account is likely closed. Closed accounts are not returned by the Plaid API.\n\nWhen using a CRA endpoint (an endpoint associated with Plaid Check Consumer Report, i.e. any endpoint beginning with `/cra/`), the `account_id` returned will not match the `account_id` returned by a non-CRA endpoint.\n\nLike all Plaid identifiers, the `account_id` is case sensitive."

While other endpoints, such as `/accounts/get`, return a balance object, only `/accounts/balance/get` forces the available and current balance fields to be refreshed rather than cached. This endpoint can be used for existing Items that were added via any of Plaid’s other products. This endpoint can be used as long as Link has been initialized with any other product, `balance` itself is not a product that can be used to initialize Link. As this endpoint triggers a synchronous request for fresh data, latency may be higher than for other Plaid endpoints (typically less than 10 seconds, but occasionally up to 30 seconds or more); if you encounter errors, you may find it necessary to adjust your timeout period when making requests.",

Payments can be one-time or standing order (recurring) and can be denominated in either EUR, GBP or other chosen [currency](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/payment-initiation/#payment_initiation-payment-create-request-amount-currency).  If making domestic GBP-denominated payments, your recipient must have been created with BACS numbers. In general, EUR-denominated payments will be sent via SEPA Credit Transfer, GBP-denominated payments will be sent via the Faster Payments network and for non-Eurozone markets typically via the local payment scheme, but the payment network used will be determined by the institution. Payments sent via Faster Payments will typically arrive immediately, while payments sent via SEPA Credit Transfer or other local payment schemes will typically arrive in one business day.\n\nStanding orders (recurring payments) must be denominated in GBP and can only be sent to recipients in the UK. Once created, standing order payments cannot be modified or canceled via the API. An end user can cancel or modify a standing order directly on their banking application or website, or by contacting the bank. Standing orders will follow the payment rules of the underlying rails (Faster Payments in UK). Payments can be sent Monday to Friday, excluding bank holidays. If the pre-arranged date falls on a weekend or bank holiday, the payment is made on the next working day. It is not possible to guarantee the exact time the payment will reach the recipient’s account, although at least 90% of standing order payments are sent by 6am.\n\nIn Limited Production, payments must be below 5 GBP or other chosen [currency](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/payment-initiation/#payment_initiation-payment-create-request-amount-currency), and standing orders, variable recurring payments, and Virtual Accounts are not supported.",

It may re-enter this state if additional input is required.\n\n`PAYMENT_STATUS_AUTHORISING`: **Transitional.** The payment is being authorised by the financial institution. It will automatically move on once authorisation completes.\n\n`PAYMENT_STATUS_INITIATED`: **Transitional.** The payment has been authorised and accepted by the financial institution and is now in transit. A payment should be considered complete once it reaches the `PAYMENT_STATUS_EXECUTED` state or the funds settle in the recipient account.\n\n`PAYMENT_STATUS_EXECUTED`: **Terminal.** The funds have left the payer’s account and the payment is en route to settlement. Support is more common in the UK than in the EU; where unsupported, a successful payment remains in `PAYMENT_STATUS_INITIATED` before settling. When using Plaid Virtual Accounts, `PAYMENT_STATUS_EXECUTED` is not terminal—the payment will continue to `PAYMENT_STATUS_SETTLED` once funds are available.\n\n`PAYMENT_STATUS_SETTLED`: **Terminal.** The funds are available in the recipient’s account. Only available to customers using [Plaid Virtual Accounts](https://plaid.com/docs/payment-initiation/virtual-accounts/).\n\nFailure statuses:\n\n`PAYMENT_STATUS_INSUFFICIENT_FUNDS`: **Terminal.** The payment failed due to insufficient funds. No further retries will succeed until the payer’s balance is replenished.\n\n`PAYMENT_STATUS_FAILED`: **Terminal (retryable).** The payment could not be initiated due to a system error or outage. Retry once the root cause is resolved.\n\n`PAYMENT_STATUS_BLOCKED`: **Terminal (retryable).** The payment was blocked by Plaid (e.g., flagged as risky). Resolve any compliance or risk issues and retry.\n\n`PAYMENT_STATUS_REJECTED`: **Terminal.** The payment was rejected by the financial institution. No automatic retry is possible.\n\n`PAYMENT_STATUS_CANCELLED`: **Terminal.** The end user cancelled the payment during authorisation.\n\nStanding-order statuses:\n\n`PAYMENT_STATUS_ESTABLISHED`: **Terminal.** A recurring/standing order has been successfully created.\n\nDeprecated (to be removed in a future release):\n\n`PAYMENT_STATUS_UNKNOWN`: The payment status is unknown.  \n\n`PAYMENT_STATUS_PROCESSING`: The payment is currently being processed.  \n\n`PAYMENT_STATUS_COMPLETED`: Indicates that the standing order has been successfully established."

It may re-enter this state if additional input is required.\n\n`PAYMENT_STATUS_AUTHORISING`: **Transitional.** The payment is being authorised by the financial institution. It will automatically move on once authorisation completes.\n\n`PAYMENT_STATUS_INITIATED`: **Transitional.** The payment has been authorised and accepted by the financial institution and is now in transit. A payment should be considered complete once it reaches the `PAYMENT_STATUS_EXECUTED` state or the funds settle in the recipient account.\n\n`PAYMENT_STATUS_EXECUTED`: **Terminal.** The funds have left the payer’s account and the payment is en route to settlement. Support is more common in the UK than in the EU; where unsupported, a successful payment remains in `PAYMENT_STATUS_INITIATED` before settling. When using Plaid Virtual Accounts, `PAYMENT_STATUS_EXECUTED` is not terminal—the payment will continue to `PAYMENT_STATUS_SETTLED` once funds are available.\n\n`PAYMENT_STATUS_SETTLED`: **Terminal.** The funds are available in the recipient’s account. Only available to customers using [Plaid Virtual Accounts](https://plaid.com/docs/payment-initiation/virtual-accounts/).\n\nFailure statuses:\n\n`PAYMENT_STATUS_INSUFFICIENT_FUNDS`: **Terminal.** The payment failed due to insufficient funds. No further retries will succeed until the payer’s balance is replenished.\n\n`PAYMENT_STATUS_FAILED`: **Terminal (retryable).** The payment could not be initiated due to a system error or outage. Retry once the root cause is resolved.\n\n`PAYMENT_STATUS_BLOCKED`: **Terminal (retryable).** The payment was blocked by Plaid (e.g., flagged as risky). Resolve any compliance or risk issues and retry.\n\n`PAYMENT_STATUS_REJECTED`: **Terminal.** The payment was rejected by the financial institution. No automatic retry is possible.\n\n`PAYMENT_STATUS_CANCELLED`: **Terminal.** The end user cancelled the payment during authorisation.\n\nStanding-order statuses:\n\n`PAYMENT_STATUS_ESTABLISHED`: **Terminal.** A recurring/standing order has been successfully created.\n\nDeprecated (to be removed in a future release):\n\n`PAYMENT_STATUS_UNKNOWN`: The payment status is unknown.  \n\n`PAYMENT_STATUS_PROCESSING`: The payment is currently being processed.  \n\n`PAYMENT_STATUS_COMPLETED`: Indicates that the standing order has been successfully established."
