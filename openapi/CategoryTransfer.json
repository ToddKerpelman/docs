        "description": "Use the `/transfer/authorization/create` endpoint to authorize a transfer. This endpoint must be called prior to calling `/transfer/create`. The transfer authorization will expire if not used after one hour. (You can contact your account manager to change the default authorization lifetime.)\n\nThere are four possible outcomes to calling this endpoint:\n\n  - If the `authorization.decision` in the response is `declined`, the proposed transfer has failed the risk check and you cannot proceed with the transfer.\n\n  - If the `authorization.decision` is `user_action_required`, additional user input is needed, usually to fix a broken bank connection, before Plaid can properly assess the risk. You need to launch Link in update mode to complete the required user action. When calling `/link/token/create` to get a new Link token, instead of providing `access_token` in the request, you should set [`transfer.authorization_id`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/link/#link-token-create-request-transfer-authorization-id) as the `authorization.id`. After the Link flow is completed, you may re-attempt the authorization.\n\n  - If the `authorization.decision` is `approved`, and the `authorization.rationale_code` is `null`, the transfer has passed the risk check and you can proceed to call `/transfer/create`.\n\n  - If the `authorization.decision` is `approved` and the `authorization.rationale_code` is non-`null`, the risk check could not be run: you may proceed with the transfer, but should perform your own risk evaluation. For more details, see the response schema.\n\nIn Plaid's Sandbox environment the decisions will be returned as follows:\n\n  - To approve a transfer with `null` rationale code, make an authorization request with an `amount` less than the available balance in the account.\n\n  - To approve a transfer with the rationale code `MANUALLY_VERIFIED_ITEM`, create an Item in Link through the [Same Day Micro-deposits flow](https://plaid.com/docs/auth/coverage/testing/#testing-same-day-micro-deposits).\n\n  - To get an authorization decision of `user_action_required`, [reset the login for an Item](https://plaid.com/docs/sandbox/#item_login_required).\n\n  - To decline a transfer with the rationale code `NSF`, the available balance on the account must be less than the authorization `amount`. See [Create Sandbox test data](https://plaid.com/docs/sandbox/user-custom/) for details on how to customize data in Sandbox.\n\n  - To decline a transfer with the rationale code `RISK`, the available balance on the account must be exactly $0. See [Create Sandbox test data](https://plaid.com/docs/sandbox/user-custom/) for details on how to customize data in Sandbox.",

It is recommended to send the request 15 minutes prior to the cutoff to ensure that it will be processed in time for submission before the cutoff.

It is recommended to send the request 15 minutes prior to the cutoff to ensure that it will be processed in time for submission before the cutoff.
