In that case, the new `account_id` will be different from the old `account_id`.\n\nIf an account with a specific `account_id` disappears instead of changing, the account is likely closed. Closed accounts are not returned by the Plaid API.\n\nWhen using a CRA endpoint (an endpoint associated with Plaid Check Consumer Report, i.e. any endpoint beginning with `/cra/`), the `account_id` returned will not match the `account_id` returned by a non-CRA endpoint.\n\nLike all Plaid identifiers, the `account_id` is case sensitive."

If you are migrating from an existing integration using `/transactions/get`, see the [Transactions Sync migration guide](https://plaid.com/docs/transactions/sync-migration/).\n\nThis endpoint supports `credit`, `depository`, and some `loan`-type accounts (only those with account subtype `student`). For `investments` accounts, use `/investments/transactions/get` instead.\n\nWhen retrieving paginated updates, track both the `next_cursor` from the latest response and the original cursor from the first call in which `has_more` was `true`; if a call to `/transactions/sync` fails when retrieving a paginated update (e.g due to the [`TRANSACTIONS_SYNC_MUTATION_DURING_PAGINATION`](https://plaid.com/docs/errors/transactions/#transactions_sync_mutation_during_pagination) error), the entire pagination request loop must be restarted beginning with the cursor for the first page of the update, rather than retrying only the single request that failed.\n\nIf transactions data is not yet available for the Item, which can happen if the Item was not initialized with transactions during the `/link/token/create` call or if `/transactions/sync` was called within a few seconds of Item creation, `/transactions/sync` will return empty transactions arrays.\n\nPlaid typically checks for new transactions data between one and four times per day, depending on the institution. To find out when transactions were last updated for an Item, use the [Item Debugger](https://plaid.com/docs/account/activity/#troubleshooting-with-item-debugger) or call `/item/get`; the `item.status.transactions.last_successful_update` field will show the timestamp of the most recent successful update. To force Plaid to check for new transactions, use the `/transactions/refresh` endpoint.\n\nTo be alerted when new transactions are available, listen for the [`SYNC_UPDATES_AVAILABLE`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/transactions/#sync_updates_available) webhook.",

        "description": "Note: All new implementations are encouraged to use `/transactions/sync` rather than `/transactions/get`. `/transactions/sync` provides the same functionality as `/transactions/get` and improves developer ease-of-use for handling transactions updates.\n\nThe `/transactions/get` endpoint allows developers to receive user-authorized transaction data for credit, depository, and some loan-type accounts (only those with account subtype `student`; coverage may be limited). For transaction history from investments accounts, use the [Investments endpoint](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/investments/) instead. Transaction data is standardized across financial institutions, and in many cases transactions are linked to a clean name, entity type, location, and category. Similarly, account data is standardized and returned with a clean name, number, balance, and other meta information where available.\n\nTransactions are returned in reverse-chronological order, and the sequence of transaction ordering is stable and will not shift.  Transactions are not immutable and can also be removed altogether by the institution; a removed transaction will no longer appear in `/transactions/get`.  For more details, see [Pending and posted transactions](https://plaid.com/docs/transactions/transactions-data/#pending-and-posted-transactions).\n\nDue to the potentially large number of transactions associated with an Item, results are paginated. Manipulate the `count` and `offset` parameters in conjunction with the `total_transactions` response body field to fetch all available transactions.\n\nData returned by `/transactions/get` will be the data available for the Item as of the most recent successful check for new transactions. Plaid typically checks for new data multiple times a day, but these checks may occur less frequently, such as once a day, depending on the institution. To find out when the Item was last updated, use the [Item Debugger](https://plaid.com/docs/account/activity/#troubleshooting-with-item-debugger) or call `/item/get`; the `item.status.transactions.last_successful_update` field will show the timestamp of the most recent successful update. To force Plaid to check for new transactions, you can use the `/transactions/refresh` endpoint.\n\nNote that data may not be immediately available to `/transactions/get`. Plaid will begin to prepare transactions data upon Item link, if Link was initialized with `transactions`, or upon the first call to `/transactions/get`, if it wasn't. To be alerted when transaction data is ready to be fetched, listen for the [`INITIAL_UPDATE`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/transactions/#initial_update) and [`HISTORICAL_UPDATE`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/transactions/#historical_update) webhooks. If no transaction history is ready when `/transactions/get` is called, it will return a `PRODUCT_NOT_READY` error.",

In those cases, the field controls the maximum number of days of transaction history that Plaid will request from the financial institution. The more transaction history is requested, the longer the historical update poll will take. If no value is specified, 90 days of history will be requested by default. If a value under 30 is provided, a minimum of 30 days of history will be requested.\n\nIf you are initializing your Items with transactions during the `/link/token/create` call (e.g. by including `transactions` in the `/link/token/create` `products` array), you must use the [`transactions.days_requested`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/link/#link-token-create-request-transactions-days-requested) field in the `/link/token/create` request instead of in the `/transactions/get` request.\n\nIf the Item has already been initialized with the Transactions product, this field will have no effect. The maximum amount of transaction history to request on an Item cannot be updated if Transactions has already been added to the Item.

        "description": "The `/transactions/recurring/get` endpoint allows developers to receive a summary of the recurring outflow and inflow streams (expenses and deposits) from a user’s checking, savings or credit card accounts. Additionally, Plaid provides key insights about each recurring stream including the category, merchant, last amount, and more. Developers can use these insights to build tools and experiences that help their users better manage cash flow, monitor subscriptions, reduce spend, and stay on track with bill payments.\n\nThis endpoint is offered as an add-on to Transactions. To request access to this endpoint, submit a [product access request](https://dashboard.plaid.com/team/products) or contact your Plaid account manager.\n\nThis endpoint can only be called on an Item that has already been initialized with Transactions (either during Link, by specifying it in `/link/token/create`; or after Link, by calling `/transactions/get` or `/transactions/sync`).\n\nWhen using Recurring Transactions, for best results, make sure to use the [`days_requested`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/link/#link-token-create-request-transactions-days-requested) parameter to request at least 180 days of history when initializing Items with Transactions. Once all historical transactions have been fetched, call `/transactions/recurring/get` to receive the Recurring Transactions streams and subscribe to the [`RECURRING_TRANSACTIONS_UPDATE`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/transactions/#recurring_transactions_update) webhook. To know when historical transactions have been fetched, if you are using `/transactions/sync` listen for the [`SYNC_UPDATES_AVAILABLE`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/transactions/#SyncUpdatesAvailableWebhook-historical-update-complete) webhook and check that the `historical_update_complete` field in the payload is `true`. If using `/transactions/get`, listen for the [`HISTORICAL_UPDATE`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/transactions/#historical_update) webhook.\n\nAfter the initial call, you can call `/transactions/recurring/get` endpoint at any point in the future to retrieve the latest summary of recurring streams. Listen to the [`RECURRING_TRANSACTIONS_UPDATE`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/transactions/#recurring_transactions_update) webhook to be notified when new updates are available.",

The on-demand extraction takes place in addition to the periodic extractions that automatically occur one or more times per day for any Transactions-enabled Item. The Item must already have Transactions added as a product in order to call `/transactions/refresh`.\n\nIf changes to transactions are discovered after calling `/transactions/refresh`, Plaid will fire a webhook: for `/transactions/sync` users, [`SYNC_UPDATES_AVAILABLE`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/transactions/#sync_updates_available) will be fired if there are any transactions updated, added, or removed. For users of both `/transactions/sync` and `/transactions/get`, [`TRANSACTIONS_REMOVED`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/transactions/#transactions_removed) will be fired if any removed transactions are detected, and [`DEFAULT_UPDATE`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/transactions/#default_update) will be fired if any new transactions are detected. New transactions can be fetched by calling `/transactions/get` or `/transactions/sync`.\n\nNote that the `/transactions/refresh` endpoint is not supported for Capital One (`ins_128026`) non-depository accounts and will result in a `PRODUCTS_NOT_SUPPORTED` error if called on an Item that contains only non-depository accounts from that institution.\n\nAs this endpoint triggers a synchronous request for fresh data, latency may be higher than for other Plaid endpoints (typically less than 10 seconds, but occasionally up to 30 seconds or more); if you encounter errors, you may find it necessary to adjust your timeout period when making requests.\n\n`/transactions/refresh` is offered as an optional add-on to Transactions and has a separate [fee model](/docs/account/billing/#per-request-flat-fee).

This value will not change unless Plaid can't reconcile the account with the data returned by the financial institution. This may occur, for example, when the name of the account changes.

In that case, the new `account_id` will be different from the old `account_id`.\n\nIf an account with a specific `account_id` disappears instead of changing, the account is likely closed. Closed accounts are not returned by the Plaid API.\n\nWhen using a CRA endpoint (an endpoint associated with Plaid Check Consumer Report, i.e. any endpoint beginning with `/cra/`), the `account_id` returned will not match the `account_id` returned by a non-CRA endpoint.\n\nLike all Plaid identifiers, the `account_id` is case sensitive."

        "description": "`/investments/refresh` is an optional endpoint for users of the Investments product. It initiates an on-demand extraction to fetch the newest investment holdings and transactions for an Item. This on-demand extraction takes place in addition to the periodic extractions that automatically occur one or more times per day for any Investments-enabled Item. If changes to investments are discovered after calling `/investments/refresh`, Plaid will fire webhooks: [`HOLDINGS: DEFAULT_UPDATE`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/investments/#holdings-default_update) if any new holdings are detected, and [`INVESTMENTS_TRANSACTIONS: DEFAULT_UPDATE`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/investments/#investments_transactions-default_update) if any new investment transactions are detected. This webhook will typically not fire in the Sandbox environment, due to the lack of dynamic investment transactions and holdings data. To test this webhook in Sandbox, call `/sandbox/item/fire_webhook`. Updated holdings and investment transactions can be fetched by calling `/investments/holdings/get` and `/investments/transactions/get`. Note that the `/investments/refresh` endpoint is not supported by all institutions. If called on an Item from an institution that does not support this functionality, it will return a `PRODUCT_NOT_SUPPORTED` error.\n\nAs this endpoint triggers a synchronous request for fresh data, latency may be higher than for other Plaid endpoints (typically less than 10 seconds, but occasionally up to 30 seconds or more); if you encounter errors, you may find it necessary to adjust your timeout period when making requests.\n\n`/investments/refresh` is offered as an add-on to Investments and has a separate [fee model](/docs/account/billing/#per-request-flat-fee). To request access to this endpoint, submit a [product access request](https://dashboard.plaid.com/team/products) or contact your Plaid account manager.",
